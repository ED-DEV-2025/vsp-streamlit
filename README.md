# vsp-streamlit

This simple Streamlit app demonstrates a virtual simulated patient (VSP).
Upload a case file in JSON format and chat with the patient in plain English.

### Customisation
Learning designers can tweak values in `config.py` to adjust scoring
thresholds or question weights without changing the main code.

### Example Case
An example case file `example_case.json` is provided for testing the app.
